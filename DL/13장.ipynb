Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["2/2 [==============================] - 0s 6ms/step - loss: 0.5366 - accuracy: 0.8095\n","2/2 [==============================] - 0s 7ms/step - loss: 0.3134 - accuracy: 0.8571\n","2/2 [==============================] - 0s 7ms/step - loss: 0.9526 - accuracy: 0.8095\n","2/2 [==============================] - 0s 6ms/step - loss: 0.9865 - accuracy: 0.8049\n","2/2 [==============================] - 0s 7ms/step - loss: 0.4047 - accuracy: 0.8293\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 정확도 평균 구하기\n","avg_acc_score = sum(acc_score)/k"],"metadata":{"id":"QwFq8rukYRBa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1674389535794,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"혜빈","userId":"05716360000115035213"}}},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 결과 출력\n","print('정확도:', acc_score)\n","print('정확도 평균:', avg_acc_score)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"1USfhOD4YUrK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1674389541017,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":617,"user":{"displayName":"혜빈","userId":"05716360000115035213"}},"outputId":"0d304254-17a0-450e-ac11-5340d8c28eff"},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["정확도: [0.8095238208770752, 0.9047619104385376, 0.8333333134651184, 0.8095238208770752, 0.8571428656578064, 0.8095238208770752, 0.8048780560493469, 0.8292682766914368]\n","정확도 평균: 1.3315911769866944\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"z3_WgejSZMto"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"https://github.com/taehojo/deeplearning/blob/master/colab/ch13-colab.ipynb","timestamp":1674388401738},{"file_id":"https://github.com/taehojo/deeplearning/blob/master/colab/ch13-colab.ipynb","timestamp":1642730761008}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.7"},"accelerator":"GPU","gpuClass":"standard"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
